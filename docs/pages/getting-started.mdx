## Coop Creator Score API

The Coop Creator Score API is now live! This API was built for the Base and Talent Protocol teams to help track onchain reputation for creators.

**Base domain:**  
`https://cooprecords.xyz/api/creator/score?address=[address]`

Replace `[address]` with the Ethereum address of the creator you want to look up.

### What does the API return?

The API returns a JSON object with the creator's score and related metrics, such as:

- **Total creator revenue**
- **Unique minters/collectors**
- And more!

You can use this API to integrate creator reputation data into your own applications or dashboards.
